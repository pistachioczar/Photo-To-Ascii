Title - Java Picture to ASCII Converter <br />
Author - Zachary Hargett <br />
About - This is a converter that takes a picture file and translates it to ascii art. <br />
What I wish to add - 

	* I want to be able to convert videos into ascii. 
	* I want to add a way to make the ascii in color and not just black and white.
